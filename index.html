    <h1>üç¶ Gelato</h1>
    <p>
      The main ingredients are milk, cream, various types of sugar and
      flavorings (such as fresh fruit or nut puree).
      <br />
      The history of gelato dates back to frozen desserts served in Ancient Rome
      and Egypt, which were made from snow and ice stored underground. Later,
      frozen desserts were served at banquets at the Medici court in Florence.
      The chef from Florence, Bernardo Buontalenti, is also considered the
      father of modern ice cream ‚Äì he presented his recipe and freezing
      techniques to Catherine de Medici. Queen Catherine brought this innovation
      to France, where in 1686 the Sicilian fisherman Francesco Procopio dei
      Coltelli perfected the first ice cream machine.
